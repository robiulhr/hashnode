## Introduction

Hello developers, hope you're all doing great. I've noticed a common challenge among many aspiring developers ‚Äì the quest for unique project ideas to apply their programming skills. Beginners often find themselves at a crossroads, having learned the fundamental concepts and tools but struggling to find truly distinctive project ideas.

The internet is flooded with project ideas, but most of them are similar, done, and redone by countless developers. You search online, and every "best React.js project ideas" list gives you d√©j√† vu.

It's like, "Come on, give me something different!"

Now, imagine this scenario: Hundreds of developers undertake the same project. How do you stand out? How do you showcase your unique abilities? How do you show that you've got that special sauce, that secret ingredient?

Well, it's not about reinventing the wheel every time. Sometimes, it's the little tweaks that turn something ordinary into something extraordinary. Not every project needs to be groundbreaking; sometimes, the magic is in the refinement and personal touch you bring to the table.

The trick is in taking a project and making it uniquely yours. You don't have to reinvent the wheel with every project. Sometimes, the real magic happens when you put your own spin on something familiar. it's about taking a common project and putting your own spin on it, making it uniquely yours.

Recruiters understand this reality. They don't expect every candidate to present an entirely unique project. What they look for is the ability to innovate, to turn something common into something special. Demonstrating your knack for improvement and creativity on a familiar project is equally valuable.

So, let's explore how you can transform a simple and ubiquitous project into something truly unique. And to keep it real, we're going to do this with a classic: the Tic Tac Toe game.

> Note: Before we dive in, I want to make something crystal clear. I'm not here to walk you through the code. What I am going to do is share some feature ideas that can turn a simple Tic Tac Toe into something totally unique. The goal is for you to take these ideas and apply them to other projects as well.  
> While my primary focus in this article is on frontend development, it's important to note that these techniques can be adapted for backend projects as well.

## Basic features

To make the article more interesting and inspiring I have already made a version of tic tac toe using react and react router dom.

let me spill the beans on the secret sauce that turned my Tic Tac Toe from ordinary to extraordinary.

1. **A Game of Choices: More Tiles, More Fun!**
    
    * **Feature Description:** I added a feature that lets players pick how big they want their Tic Tac Toe playground to be. You know, Tic Tac Toe is usually on a 3x3 grid. Well, not anymore!  
        Now, you can choose to play on a classic 3x3 board, spice things up with a 4x4 challenge, or go all-in for a brain-bending 5x5 experience. It's like choosing your adventure but in Tic Tac Toe land.  
        More tiles, more fun ‚Äì you're in control!

    * **What You'll Learn:** By adding this feature, you'll learn how to organize your React app with reusable parts, making it easier to manage. You'll also get the hang of showing different things based on user choices, like changing the board size. It's like learning to adjust parts of your app depending on what the user picks or the app's current situation.
        
2. **The 10-Second Countdown! Feature Description:**
    
    * **Quick Decision Time:** You're playing your move, but here's the catch ‚Äì you only have 10 seconds! It's like a little race against the clock in your Tic Tac Toe adventure. Feel the excitement, make your move before the countdown hits zero, and all's good.  
        But here's the twist ‚Äì if you take too long, your move gets tossed into a random spot. It's like a speedy game of Tic Tac Toe with a time limit ‚Äì can you beat the clock? üïêüí®
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700475589805/c0d49d2d-1a06-48df-b6b2-7837ba78b788.png align="center")
        
    * **What You'll Learn:** Adding this feature will teach you how to manage asynchronous operations. You'll be working with the [`setTimeout`](https://robiul.dev/javascript-settimeout-method-all-you-need-to-know) method, and it's crucial to handle it carefully to avoid memory leaks. This hands-on experience will enhance your grasp of `asynchronous code`, [`event loops`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Event_loop), `stacks`, and more.
        
3. **Rewind and Replay! History Feature:**
    
    * **Feature Description**: With the History Feature, you can look back at every move you've made, go back to any point you want, and redo your moves. It's like having a magical time machine in your Tic Tac Toe game. But, a heads up ‚Äì if you decide to change things up, anything after that point is wiped out. So, choose your moves wisely and have fun exploring your game journey!

    * **What You'll Learn:** Implementing this feature provides hands-on experience with manipulating [arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) and [objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) more effectively. You'll dive into using advanced array and object methods, gaining valuable insights for real-world applications.
        
4. **Prevent Page Leave: No Escape Until Victory!**
    
    * **Feature Description:** Here's the deal with Prevent Page Leave: Imagine you're in the middle of an epic game, and suddenly you think about leaving the page. Well, not so fast! This feature throws up a popup that says, "Hold up! Are you sure you want to leave this awesome game?" You've got two choices: finish the game like a champ or leave the page by selecting exit.

    * **What You'll Learn:** This feature, though seemingly straightforward, is a unique and intriguing aspect of web development. While it may appear easy to implement, tackling it within a single-page application adds a layer of complexity. The process of implementing this feature provides an in-depth understanding of the nuances involved in single-page application development.
